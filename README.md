# Cohorts Analysis in Python

## Overview

This Python script showcases the basics of cohorts analysis, a powerful method for analyzing user behavior over time. The provided script guides users through the process of creating cohorts, calculating retention rates, and visualizing the results. Explore this script to gain insights into cohort analysis and its applications in understanding user engagement and retention.

## Script Components

- **Data Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing a sample dataset or replacing it with your own data.
- **Cohort Creation:** Defining cohorts based on user signup dates.
- **Retention Rate Calculation:** Computing retention rates for each cohort over subsequent periods.
- **Visualization:** Plotting cohort analysis results using heatmap and line chart.
- **Output Display:** Displaying visualizations for cohort analysis.

## Running the Script

1. Open and run the Python script (`cohorts_analysis.py`) in a Python environment.
2. The script will load the sample dataset (or replace it with your own) and perform cohort analysis.
3. Inspect the generated heatmap and line chart to understand user retention rates over time.

## Customization

- Replace the sample dataset with your own data for specific cohorts analysis.
- Experiment with different time periods or cohort definitions for diverse insights.
- Modify the script to include additional analysis metrics or visualizations.
